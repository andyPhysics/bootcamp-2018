# Quiz - Day 2

If you have not already done so, checkout the GitHub repository. Compile and
execute `quizzes/day2/quiz02.cpp`. The execution should result in a
segmentation fault. Try to find out what is causing the segmentation fault by
debugging the code with `gdb` and fix it without changing any data member. Are
there more bugs in the code? If yes, fix those as well. Hint: use `valgrind`
and run a memory check. Even after fixing all bugs, is this a good class
design? What would you change?

**Note:** It is more fun if you do not read the content of `quiz02.cpp`
beforehand.
